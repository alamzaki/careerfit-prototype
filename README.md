CareerFit Prototype

This is a lean prototype I built as part of my Product Experimentation Intern assignment for With/Care Ventures.

The goal of this experiment is to test one simple idea:
👉 Can a short interactive quiz help students quickly find career paths that fit their strengths and today’s job market?

🎯 What this prototype does

Shows a clean landing page with a clear promise: “Find your career fit in under 2 minutes.”

Runs a 6-question quiz about skills, values, and work style.

Gives 3 suggested career paths instantly (Wizard-of-Oz style simulation).

Asks for an email to unlock the “full report” (market data + roadmap).

Lets users give quick feedback with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down.

🛠 Why this approach

Instead of building a heavy product, I kept it lightweight and fast:

The quiz is the hook feature — students get value in <2 minutes.

The email gate is the signal of demand — if people submit, it shows they care.

The feedback buttons act as a signal of feasibility — do students trust the results?

This way, I could validate or reject the riskiest assumption (demand) without weeks of coding.

📊 What I’m testing

Primary Metric: Quiz → Email conversion (demand signal).

Success Threshold: At least 25% of users submitting their email.

Secondary Metrics:

Thumbs-up rate ≥ 60% (accuracy feel).

University demo requests (viability).

🚀 Next steps

If results are positive: Expand into MVP-1 with a Market Dashboard + Recruiting Tracker.

If results are negative: Pivot the hook (maybe start with Recruiting Tracker) and re-test.
