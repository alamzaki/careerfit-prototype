# CareerFit Prototype  - Zaki Alam

This is a lean prototype I built as part of my **Product Experimentation Intern assignment for With/Care Ventures**.  

The goal of this experiment is simple:  
👉 *Can a short interactive quiz help students quickly find career paths that fit their strengths and today’s job market?*  

---

## 🎯 What this prototype does  
- Clean landing page with a clear promise: *“Find your career fit in under 2 minutes.”*  
- **10-question quiz** about skills, values, and work style.  
- Shows **suggested career paths instantly*.  
- Asks for an **email to unlock the full report** (market data + roadmap).  
- Includes quick **thumbs-up / thumbs-down feedback** on accuracy.  

---

## 🛠 Why this approach  
Instead of building a heavy product, I kept it **lightweight and fast**:  
- The quiz is the **hook feature** — students get value in <2 minutes.  
- The email gate is the signal of demand — if people submit, it shows they want it.  
- The feedback buttons act as a signal of feasibility — do students trust the results?  

This lets me validate or reject the riskiest assumption. 

---

## 📊 What I’m testing  
- **Primary Metric:** Quiz → Email conversion (demand signal).  
- **Success Threshold:** At least **25%** of users submitting their email.  
- **Secondary Metrics:**  
  - Thumbs-up rate ≥ **60%** (accuracy feel).  
  - University demo requests (viability).  

---

## 🚀 Next steps  
- **If positive:** Expand into MVP-1 with Market Dashboard + Recruiting Tracker.  
- **If negative:** Pivot the hook (e.g., lead with Recruiting Tracker) and re-test.

## 📌 Notes  
- This is **not a full product**, only an experiment surface to collect signals.  
- Built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** — no backend.

By keeping it simple, I could test the idea quickly and see if students really want this kind of tool.
